# Chaos Game

A simple app I made after seeing this [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbKtFN71Lfs) by Numberphile. It renders a Sierpi≈Ñski triangle after the user has chosen a triangle and a cursor point. The algorithm works this way: starting from the cursor point and one of the vertices, a new point is generated that lies at half the distance between these two points (which becomes the new cursor point). The resulting figure is a fractal.

## Installation

The only requirement is having Visual Studio installed on your computer. Clone the project and then run it.
